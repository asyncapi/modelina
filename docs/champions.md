# Maintainers
As Modelina grows, more and more people would like to become maintainers, each with varying degree of time to give.

In order to have something for everyone, we introduce the concept of `champions` where we split up the areas of responsibility where best possible. 

All champions are maintainers of Modelina will automatic become members of the [TSC](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc). 

## Input champions
Input champions are those who take charge of the input processing, it can either be a specific input processor (such as JSON Schema or AsyncAPI) or multiple. They maintain the process of converting the input to the internal model which Modelina can use to generate outputs to.

## Language champions
Language champions are those who maintain of a specific language output, it can either be a specific generator (such as TypeScript or Java) or or multiple. They maintain the process of converting the internal model into usable data models in their respective language. 

## Becoming a champion
There can be many ways to become a champion, but what they all have in common is regularly contributing to the project. There is no limit to who or how many can become champions of a specific area. You can also become a general maintainer with no specific area, especially if you like to do it all :tada:
