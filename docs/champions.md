# Champions
As Modelina grows, more and more people would like to become maintainers, each with varying degree of time to give.

In order to have something for everyone, we introduce the concept of `champions` where we split up the areas of responsibility where best possible. Champions will have the ability to merge and accept pull requests for their [area of responsibility](#areas-of-responsibility), basically owning and maintaining a part of Modelina. This also entitles you to join the [AsyncAPI TSC](https://www.asyncapi.com/community/tsc).

You can checkout the [CODEOWNERS file](../CODEOWNERS) for an updated list of maintainers and what areas they champion.

## Areas of responsibility
These are the areas that we mainly focus on getting having champions and where you can help out. However, keep in mind it is not limited to these alone.

### :running: Core champions
There is not one area that interest you, but rather the library as a whole, where you want to maintain and push forward the project and it's vision.

### :books: Doc champions
Doc champions are those who focus on the documentation and how users best go from 0 to 100 in order to use Modelina. Maybe you like to write technical documentation, or you love making tutorials, this would be for you!

### :trident: Input champions
Input champions are those who take charge of the input processing, it can either be a specific input processor (such as JSON Schema or AsyncAPI) or multiple. They maintain the process of converting the input to the internal model which Modelina can use to generate outputs to.

### :wrench: Language champions
Language champions are those who maintain of a specific language output, it can either be a specific generator (such as TypeScript or Java) or or multiple. They maintain the process of converting the internal model into usable data models in their respective language. 

## Becoming a champion
There can be many ways to become a champion, but what they all have in common is regularly contributing to the project. There is no limit to who or how many can become champions of a specific area and you can also become champion of multiple areas.

### How to get started
The first step is always to get to know the tool, explore how and what it does. If you like to make your own side projects, try using Modelina and as you find issues, raise them and maybe even solve them. You can also look for [good first issues](https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), that are well described issues tailored for new contributors.

As you become more and more familiar with the project and continue to contribute, naturally you become a champion, like two rivers merging. 

## Stepping down as a champion
There can be countless reasons why you want to step down as a champion and it is entirely your provocative at any time.

To step down as a champion make a PR removing your name from the [CODEOWNERS file](../CODEOWNERS) and thats it :v:
