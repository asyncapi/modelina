# Migration guides

As Modelina progresses and evolves, sometimes it's inevitable that a major version change is required.

When it happens, we try to list the breaking changes and a migration guide, to make transitioning from one major version to another as painless as possible.

- [From v0 to v1](./version-0-to-1.md)
- [From v1 to v2](./version-1-to-2.md)
- [From v2 to v3](./version-2-to-3.md)
- [From v3 to v4](./version-3-to-4.md)
