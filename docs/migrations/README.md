# Migration guides

As Modelina progresses and evolves, sometimes it's inevitable that a major version change is required.

When it happens, we try to list the breaking changes and a migration guide, to make transitioning from one major version to another as painless as possible.

- [From v0 to v1](https://modelina.org/docs/migrations/version-0-to-1)
