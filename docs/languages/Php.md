# PHP
There are special use-cases that each language supports; this document pertains to **PHP models**.

At the moment, PHP models have no specific features.

## Description Present

By default, descriptions are not rendered for the model, you can change that by applying `PHP_DESCRIPTION_PRESET`.

Check out this [example for a live demonstration](../../examples/php-generate-documentation-preset).
