## Generate serializer and deserializer functionality

The most widely used use-case for Modelina is to generate models that include serialization and deserialization functionality to convert the models into payload data. This payload data can of course be many different kinds, JSON, XML, raw binary, you name it.

As you normally only need one library to do this, we developers can never get enough with creating new stuff, therefore there might be one specific library you need or want to integrate with. Therefore there is not one specific preset that offers everything. Below is a list of all the supported serialization presets. 

### To and from JSON
Here are all the supported presets and the libraries they use for converting to and from JSON:

- [JSON Tags](#json-tags)

#### JSON Tags

To generate go models that work correctly with JSON marshal functions we need to generate appropriate JSON `struct-tags`, use the preset `GO_COMMON_PRESET` and provide the option `addJsonTag: true`.

check out this [example for a live demonstration](../../examples/go-json-tags/)

### To and from XML
Currently not supported, [let everyone know you need it](https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina/issues/new?assignees=&labels=enhancement&template=enhancement.md)!

### To and from binary
