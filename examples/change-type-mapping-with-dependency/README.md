# Change type mapping that adds a new dependency

This example shows how to use a new custom type for the FloatModel, that changes its type from `number` to `MyCustomClass`, which also needs to be added as a dependency.

## How to run this example

Run this example using:

```sh
npm i && npm run start
```

If you are on Windows, use the `start:windows` script instead:

```sh
npm i && npm run start:windows
```
