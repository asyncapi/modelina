# JSON Schema allow inheritance

This example shows how to use the `allowInheritance` option on the JSON Schema input processor to enable support for inheritance in the generated models. When enabled, models can extend from other models based on the schema structure (such as `allOf` patterns).

## How to run this example

Run this example using:

```sh
npm i && npm run start
```

If you are on Windows, use the `start:windows` script instead:

```sh
npm i && npm run start:windows
```
